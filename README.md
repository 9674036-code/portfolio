### MusikHelfer (2025)

**Description:** This project is a music application with four main utilites: an Interval Ear Training Page, Tuner, Harmonizer and Metronome. The project uses the proccessing sound library in order to play a variety of pitches through piano sound files. The Interval Ear Training Page selects a random interval and scale degree and plays the interval. The user has to then guess the interval using an array of buttons and the program will respond with an indication of a correct or incorrect answer. The Tuner plays any given pitch based on user input through an array of buttons. The Harmonizer page is able to return a chord that harmonizes any given melody that the user inputs using a displayed score and the note class. The metronome repeatedly plays a sound file based on the frequency determined through user input. All of these pages are seperated and contained within their respective methods in the main file and converge within the mouseReleased and draw methods.

## Projects for Term 1

### Calculator (2025)

**Detailed description:** This project implements a multi-functional graphical calculator using the Processing framework and is structured around button-driven UI logic and custom arithmetic parsing, offering a foundation for a math education tool or calculator app. It supports standard arithmetic calculations, graphing mathematical expressions with respect to variable x, custom graph window scaling and advanced mathematical functions like logarithm, square root, and exponents. The program features an interactive GUI composed of buttons for digits, operations, commands, and graphing utilities, rendered in a clean layout with hover and click detection.

**Usage Notes:** When using the "log" function, the base of the function is to be placed in front the log function and the number being operated on after the log function. The "√" function represents the square root function specifically, and only needs one number after it to function. In order to activate the calculator's graphing mode, this can be activated by using the Graph button and also disabled by using the Graph button again. Once the calculator is in its graphing mode, the graph will be displayed after a given expression is input and can then be graphed by pressing the EXE button. The green "x" button represents the input for the variable x and is exclusive to the calculator's graphing mode. The graphing window can then be disabled by pressing the EXE button again. All expressions must be expanded, for example, 3x will expressed as 3Xx, excluding negatives. In order to adjust the window of the graphing display, press the "Window" button and input the ranges of the x and y axis by using the calculators normal inputs and use EXE to alternate from the x range to y range and press it once again to verify the changes. Similarly, this display can also be disabled by pressing the "Window" button once again, although any changes will not be saved without pressing EXE twice before displaying the window. Also, the window will automatically disable after pressing EXE twice. The x and y ranges that the calculator assumes before one changes them is set as 20.

### MakingCars(2025)

**Description:** This project uses an object-based approach in order to create and display an array of 100 "car" objects on the screen. Each car moves and accelerates horizontally across the screen and resets its position once the given car reaches the edge of the diplay.

### Grade Converter(2025)

**Description:** This project provides a simple application in which the user can input a PBL-based grade on scale from 0 to 4 using the poisition of thier mouse on the timeline displayed. The program will then return a letter-grade based on the user's input that is displayed on the screen.

### Timeline(2025)

**Description:** This project uses a series of if blocks in order to determine the user's mouse position in order to display varying text onto the screen depending on mouse position, creating an interactive timeline in which the user can learn a very brief history regarding the development of computers.
