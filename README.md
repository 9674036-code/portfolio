### Calculator (2025)

Detailed description 
This project implements a multi-functional graphical calculator using the Processing framework and is structured around button-driven UI logic and custom arithmetic parsing, offering a foundation for a math education tool or calculator app. It supports standard arithmetic calculations, graphing mathematical expressions with respect to variable x, custom graph window scaling and advanced mathematical functions like logarithm, square root, and exponents. The program features an interactive GUI composed of buttons for digits, operations, commands, and graphing utilities, rendered in a clean layout with hover and click detection.
