## Projects for Term 1

### Calculator (2025)

**Detailed description:** This project implements a multi-functional graphical calculator using the Processing framework and is structured around button-driven UI logic and custom arithmetic parsing, offering a foundation for a math education tool or calculator app. It supports standard arithmetic calculations, graphing mathematical expressions with respect to variable x, custom graph window scaling and advanced mathematical functions like logarithm, square root, and exponents. The program features an interactive GUI composed of buttons for digits, operations, commands, and graphing utilities, rendered in a clean layout with hover and click detection.

**Usage Notes:** When using the "log" function, the base of the function is to be placed in front the log function and the number being operated on after the log function. The "√" function represents the square root function specifically, and only needs one number after it to function. In order to activate the calculator's graphing mode, this can be activated by using the Graph button and also disabled by using the Graph button again. Once the calculator is in its graphing mode, the graph will be displayed after a given expression is input and can then be graphed by pressing the EXE button. The green "x" button represents the input for the variable x and is exclusive to the calculator's graphing mode. The graphing window can then be disabled by pressing the EXE button again. All expressions must be expanded, for example, 3x will expressed as 3Xx, excluding negatives. In order to adjust the window of the graphing display, press the "Window" button and input the ranges of the x and y axis by using the calculators normal inputs and use EXE to alternate from the x range to y range and press it once again to verify the changes. Similarly, this display can also be disabled by pressing the "Window" button once again, although any changes will not be saved without pressing EXE twice before displaying the window. Also, the window will automatically disable after pressing EXE twice. The x and y ranges that the calculator assumes before one changes them is set as 20.
